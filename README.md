ChatBot Server
Overview
Welcome to the ChatBot Server project! This repository contains the implementation of a multithreaded server application designed for real-time communication between multiple clients and a central server. Built using C, POSIX Threads, and TCP/IP socket programming, this project showcases a robust and efficient client-server interaction mechanism with integrated chatbot functionality.

Features
Multithreaded Server: Handles concurrent client connections efficiently.
Bidirectional Communication: Enables seamless message exchange between clients and the server.
Basic Chatbot: Provides intelligent responses to client messages based on predefined logic.
Thread Synchronization: Ensures thread safety using mutex locks and condition variables.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Libraries: POSIX Threads (pthread), Socket Programming (TCP/IP)
Development Tools: Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc.), Linux command line tools for compilation and execution.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
GCC Compiler
Linux Operating System (recommended for POSIX threads)
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatBotServer.git
cd ChatBotServer
Compile the server and client:

sh
Copy code
gcc -pthread -o server server.c
gcc -o client client.c
Usage
Running the Server
Start the server:
sh
Copy code
./server
Running the Client
Open a new terminal and run the client:

sh
Copy code
./client
Connect multiple clients by opening new terminals and running the client command again.

Project Structure
server.c: Contains the implementation of the multithreaded server.
client.c: Contains the implementation of the client.
README.md: Project documentation.
LICENSE: License information.
Future Enhancements
Advanced Chatbot: Integrate machine learning or NLP techniques for more intelligent responses.
Security Enhancements: Implement secure communication protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) and user authentication.
GUI Development: Create a graphical user interface for clients to enhance usability.
Scalability: Optimize server performance for handling larger numbers of concurrent client connections.
